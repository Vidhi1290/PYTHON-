# PYTHON IN DATA SCIENCE

Python has long been the most intriguing and rapidly expanding data language. When we choose to study Python, however, it gets a bit perplexing to pick among thousands of free resources on the internet to learn from. Here is a basic to intermediate overview of the Python language, including an introduction to the most significant libraries used in machine learning models, namely pandas and numpy.

So, don't be confused, and begin your Python adventure by learning the fundamentals of Python first and then progressing to the most complex version of Python, as I have covered all the jupyter notebooks for each session for a better understanding.
I hope this helps!

The flow of basic to advance would go like:

### 1. BASICS:

Includes the base of the language at the same time most important thing to get started with:
Operators and Data Types
Conditional statements - ifelse, switch, case
Loops - while, for
Data Structures - Arrays, List, Dict, etc
Define function

### 2. ALL ABOUT LOOPS:

Covers the most interesting part of algorithms:

FOR LOOP 

WHILE LOOP

NESTED LOOPS

BREAK STATEMENT

CONTINUE STATEMENT

PASS STATEMENT

### 3. LAMBDA FUNCTIONS AND USER DEFINED FUNCTIONS:

This Jupyter notebook will help you in decoding the mysteries of an anonymous function.

### 4. NUMPY 

`Numpy` is short for Numerical Python. It is the fundamental package required for high performance scientific computing and data analysis

### 5. DATA ANALYSIS WITH PANDAS:

`Pandas` (most interesting library in Data world) is an open source Python library for data analysis. It gives Python the
ability to work with spreadsheet-like data for fast data loading, manipulating,
aligning, merging, etc. To give Python these enhanced features, Pandas introduces two new data types to Python: `Series` and `DataFrame`.

### 6. MERGING AND CONCAT:

1. `concat()` simply stacks multiple DataFrame together either vertically, or stitches horizontally after aligning on index. 
2. `merge()` first aligns two DataFrame ' selected common column(s) or index, and then pick up the remaining columns from the aligned rows of each DataFrame .

### 7. FUNCTIONS:

DIVE DEEP INTO THE BASICS BY UNERSTANDING THE:

Data types
if-else, for, while
comprehensions

Functions:
predefined functions
[x] user defined functions
Higher Order functions

### 8. ERRORS AND DEBUGGING 

UNDERTSAND AND DEBUG THE MOST IRRITATING ERRORS YOU WILL COME ACROSS, SO BE READY:

Syntax Error

Index Error

Key Error

Value Error

Errortype Error

ZeroDivision Error

File Error

### 9. REGEX

This is interesting as you'll learn to search for patterns of text in python.

### 10. OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING:

Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. It supports different programming approaches.

One of the popular approaches to solve a programming problem is by creating objects. This is known as Object-Oriented

This jupyter notebook covers up the:
Classes in OOP
Objects used in OOP

### 11. CLASSES:

INCLUDES THE CONCEPTS LIKE

Operator Overloading

Mathematical Operator

Relational Operator

Assignment Operator

### 12. CODE EFFICIENCY MODULES:

This includes the understanding and implementation of concepts like:

time

timeit

profiling

line profiling

memory profiling

### 13. MULTITASKING -- MULTITHREADING

Multithreading refers to concurrently executing multiple threads by rapidly switching the control of the CPU between threads (called context switching). The Python Global Interpreter Lock limits one thread to run at a time even if the machine contains multiple processors.

### 14. MYSQL LAB:

It would go like:

MySQL - email with MySQL host, port no, user, and passwoard has sent by INSOFE Admin

Python - mysql.connector - enables python program to access MySQL DB

Python_MySQL - Connecting to MySQL DB Server

### 15. MONGODB ATLAS LAB:

Getting started with MongoDB Atlas
